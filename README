Symfony is a complete framework designed to optimize the development of web applications by way of several key features.
For starters, it separates a web application's business rules, server logic, and presentation views.
It contains numerous tools and classes aimed at shortening the development time of a complex web application.
Additionally, it automates common tasks so that the developer can focus entirely on the specifics of an application.
The end result of these advantages means there is no need to reinvent the wheel every time a new web application is built!

Symfony was written entirely in PHP 5.
It has been thoroughly tested in various real-world projects, and is actually in use for high-demand e-business websites.
It is compatible with most of the available databases engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.
It runs on *nix and Windows platforms.

FORK CHANGES
------------

1. Changing Propel's table generation to use Engine instead of Type in the
output SQL. Fixes an issue where MySQL tables cannot be created on modern MySQL
instalations.

2. Removed massive amounts of trailing whitespace.

3. Fixed repeated uses of ob_start being passed a blank string (Causes a bug in
PHP 5.4)

4. Introduced a hook in the sfApplicationConfiguration which is called before
the settings.yml is loaded. (see: `beforeSettingsConfiguration`)

5. Introduced a global lock (data/global.lck) to disable all environments in
a single call: `./symfony project:disable -g` or `./symfony project:enable -g`

6. Propel's slave handling will pick a random slave, but will attempt different
slaves until it finds a good one, or runs out. If APC is enabled, it will store
the down slave in APC and not attempt to connect to it for 60 seconds.
Additionally, it will store a list of failed slave connections in
`$_SERVER['failed-slaves']`.

7. Removed a pass-by-reference flag in UnixFileSystem which was unlike the
parent method, which caused a STRICT error in PHP 5.4.

8. Switched from using mysql_escape_string to mysql_real_escape_string in
Propel's MySQL platform. Fixes a deprecation error.

9. Fixes the logic in sfWidgetFormSelectCheckbox to support the case when the
value is an array, but does not contain the key.
